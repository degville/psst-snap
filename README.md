# psst-snap

This repository contains [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-overview) build files for the [psst](https://github.com/jpochyla/psst) unofficial Spotify client.

The snap can be manually built by cloning this project and running the _snapcraft_ command in its root.

The snap build is not endorsed by the psst project but built for my own personal use.
